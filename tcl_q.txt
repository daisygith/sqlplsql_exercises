1. EXISTS vs. IN
	Find employees who work in existing departments, using EXISTS.
	Write the same query using IN.

2. SAVEPOINT and ROLLBACK TO
Create a transaction that:
	Inserts 3 records
	Creates a SAVEPOINT after the second record
	Deletes one record and rolls back to the SAVEPOINT
	
3. NOT EXISTS vs. NOT IN
	Find employees who are not assigned to any department, using NOT EXISTS.
	Then try to achieve the same result with NOT IN â€“ see what happens if NULL appears in the subquery.
	
4. ANY vs. ALL
	Find employees who earn more than any employee in department 10 (ANY).	
	Find employees who earn more than all employees in department 20 (ALL).	

5.	Advanced transaction
Write a script that:
	Inserts several records into employees
	Creates a SAVEPOINT
	Updates a selected record
	Creates a second SAVEPOINT
	Deletes a record
	Rolls back only to the second SAVEPOINT (so the DELETE is undone, but the UPDATE remains)
	Ends with COMMIT
